# 30 Days of Code



### Days 0 - Hello World
`Task => 
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line. `


### Days 1 - Data Types
`Task =>
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables , , and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate  with s the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.`


### Days 2 - Operators
`Task =>
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.`


### Days 3 - Conditional Statements
`Task =>
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.`


### Days 4 - Class Instance
`Task =>
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as  initialAge, the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age<13, print You are young..
If age >= and , age<18 print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..`


### Days 5 - Loops
`Task =>
Given an integer, n, print its first 10  multiples. Each multiple n x i (where ) 1<=i<=10 should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.
`


### Days 6 - Let's Review
``


### Days 7 - Array
`Task =>
Given an array,A ,N of  integers, print A 's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers

Example
A=[1,2,3,4];
Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.
`


### Days 8 - Dicitonaries and Map
``


### Days 9 - Recursion
`Task =>
Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.
factorial has the following paramter: 
int n: an integer
Returns
int: the factorial of n
Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0`
